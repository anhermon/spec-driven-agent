# Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation site for the **Spec-Driven Agent Workflow**.

This folder is organized as follows:

- **index.md** – Landing page / table of contents
- **architecture/** – Deep dive into system design and component relationships
- **api/** – OpenAPI specification and reference material
- **deployment/** – Installation, configuration & troubleshooting guides
- **tutorials/** – Hands-on tutorials and walkthroughs
- **assets/** – Images, diagrams and other static assets

## Building the Docs Locally

We recommend [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the *material* theme.

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.
