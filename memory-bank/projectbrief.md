# Project Brief: Spec-Driven Agent Workflow

## Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive spec-driven development workflow that combines the best practices from BMAD-METHOD, Context Engineering, and Spec-Driven Development, enhanced with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocols.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Agent-Based Architecture
- **Analyst Agent**: Requirements gathering and stakeholder interviews
- **Product Manager Agent**: PRD creation and project planning
- **Architect Agent**: System design and technology decisions
- **Scrum Master Agent**: Task breakdown and story management
- **Developer Agent**: Code implementation
- **QA Agent**: Testing and validation
- **UX Expert Agent**: User experience design
- **Product Owner Agent**: Final validation and acceptance

### 2. Spec-Driven Development Flow
- **Phase 1**: Specification and Planning (Analyst + PM)
- **Phase 2**: Architecture and Design (Architect)
- **Phase 3**: Development (Scrum Master + Dev)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and Deployment (QA + PO)

### 3. Context Engineering Integration
- Rich context window management
- Memory persistence across sessions
- Cognitive tools and reasoning frameworks
- Symbolic mechanisms for abstract reasoning

### 4. A2A SDK Integration
- Agent-to-agent communication using A2A SDK
- Task lifecycle management via A2A protocol
- Streaming updates and push notifications
- Artifact exchange between agents

### 5. User Visibility and Control
- Real-time workflow visibility
- Interactive decision points
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Human-in-the-loop validation

## Success Criteria
1. **Complete Workflow**: End-to-end implementation from requirements to deployment
2. **Agent Collaboration**: Seamless agent-to-agent communication
3. **Context Persistence**: Maintain context across all phases
4. **User Control**: Full visibility and control over the process
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agents or modify workflows
6. **Standards Compliance**: Follow A2A protocol and industry best practices

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing AI development tools (Pydantic AI, A2A SDK)
- Support multiple IDE integrations
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Follow security best practices for agent communication
- Leverage existing tools instead of building from scratch
