# Active Context: Spec-Driven Agent Workflow

## Current Work Focus

### Phase: Planning and Architecture Design
We are currently in the **planning phase** for implementing a comprehensive spec-driven agent workflow that combines:

1. **BMAD-METHOD**: Agent orchestration framework with specialized roles
2. **Context Engineering**: Advanced context management and symbolic mechanisms
3. **Spec-Driven Development**: Design-first approach with API specifications
4. **A2A SDK**: Standardized agent-to-agent communication

### Key Objectives
- Design and implement a complete agent workflow system
- Integrate context engineering principles for persistent, rich context
- Implement A2A SDK for seamless agent communication
- Provide full user visibility and control throughout the process

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Creation
- ✅ Created `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document defining core requirements
- ✅ Created `productContext.md` - Why this project exists and how it should work
- ✅ Created `systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and design patterns
- ✅ Created `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development setup

### Analysis of Reference Materials
- ✅ Analyzed BMAD-METHOD documentation and agent patterns
- ✅ Reviewed Context Engineering principles and cognitive tools
- ✅ Studied A2A SDK specification and implementation examples
- ✅ Identified key integration points and technical requirements

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 sessions)
1. **Create Progress Tracking Document**
   - Document current implementation status
   - Define what works vs. what needs to be built
   - Identify known issues and technical debt

2. **Design Core Agent Architecture**
   - Define base agent interface and implementation
   - Design agent communication patterns using A2A SDK
   - Plan context persistence mechanisms

3. **Set Up Development Environment**

   - Set up basic project dependencies (A2A SDK, Pydantic AI)

### Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Implement Core Infrastructure**
   - A2A protocol implementation
   - Context engine with symbolic mechanisms
   - Basic agent framework

2. **Build First Agent (Analyst)**
   - Requirements gathering capabilities

   - Market research and analysis tools

3. **Create User Interface**
   - Basic web UI for workflow management
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Interactive decision points

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-2 months)
1. **Complete Agent Suite**
   - All 8 specialized agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, etc.)
   - Agent-to-agent communication
   - Task handoff mechanisms

2. **Advanced Context Engineering**
   - Symbolic reasoning mechanisms
   - Cognitive tools integration
   - Memory persistence across sessions

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Comprehensive testing suite
   - Performance optimization
   - Security hardening

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Technology Stack**: Python for core orchestration and AI agents
2. **Communication Protocol**: A2A SDK for agent communication (handles protocol, streaming, notifications)
3. **Context Storage**: Vector database for semantic search, Redis for caching, PostgreSQL for structured data
4. **Agent Framework**: Pydantic AI for agent logic, A2A SDK for communication, custom workflow orchestration

### Design Considerations
1. **User Control**: How to balance automation with user oversight
2. **Context Persistence**: Ensuring rich context is maintained across all phases
3. **Scalability**: Supporting multiple concurrent projects and users
4. **Extensibility**: Making it easy to add new agents or modify workflows

### Technical Challenges
1. **A2A SDK Integration**: Leveraging A2A SDK effectively for agent communication
2. **Context Engineering**: Building symbolic mechanisms for spec-driven development
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Managing spec-driven phase transitions and agent coordination
4. **Performance**: Ensuring fast response times with rich context and spec validation
5. **Agent Orchestration Complexity**: Coordinating multiple specialized agents with clear state management
6. **Context Synchronization**: Ensuring consistency and avoiding race conditions across agents
7. **IDE Integration**: Providing seamless integration with minimal development effort

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Technical Blockers
- **None currently identified** - Ready to begin implementation

### Potential Risks
1. **Complexity**: The system is complex and may be difficult to implement correctly
2. **Performance**: Rich context and multiple agents may impact performance
3. **User Adoption**: Users may find the workflow too complex or rigid
4. **Integration**: Integrating with existing development tools may be challenging

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Development**: Build and test components incrementally
2. **Performance Testing**: Regular performance testing and optimization
3. **User Feedback**: Early user testing and feedback collection
4. **Modular Design**: Design for easy integration and modification
5. **Clear State Management**: Implement robust state management for workflow orchestration
6. **Context Consistency**: Build strong consistency validation in SpecSymbolicEngine
7. **Phased IDE Integration**: Start with CLI, then webview, then LSP for minimal effort

## Key Insights and Learnings

### From Reference Materials
1. **BMAD-METHOD**: Provides excellent agent role definitions and workflow patterns
2. **Context Engineering**: Offers advanced techniques for maintaining rich, persistent context
3. **A2A SDK**: Provides standardized communication infrastructure
4. **Pydantic AI**: Offers AI-powered data validation and agent logic
5. **Spec-Driven Development**: Ensures consistency and quality through design-first approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Leverage Existing Tools**: Use A2A SDK and Pydantic AI instead of building from scratch
2. **Focus on Custom Logic**: Implement only spec-driven workflow orchestration and context management
3. **User-Centric**: Keep user control and visibility as primary design principles
4. **Standards-Based**: Use existing standards and SDKs for interoperability
