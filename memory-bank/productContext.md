# Product Context: Spec-Driven Agent Workflow

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Current AI-assisted development workflows suffer from several critical issues:

1. **Fragmented Context**: Information is lost between different AI tools and sessions
2. **Poor Coordination**: Multiple AI agents work in isolation without proper communication
3. **Inconsistent Quality**: No standardized approach to requirements, architecture, and implementation
4. **Limited Visibility**: Users lack insight into the development process and decision-making
5. **Manual Handoffs**: Human developers must manually coordinate between different phases

### Market Opportunity
The convergence of three powerful approaches creates a unique opportunity:

1. **BMAD-METHOD**: Proven agent orchestration framework with specialized roles
2. **Context Engineering**: Advanced techniques for maintaining rich, persistent context
3. **Spec-Driven Development**: Design-first approach ensuring consistency and quality
4. **A2A SDK**: Standardized agent communication enabling true collaboration

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Development Teams
- **Seamless Workflow**: From initial requirements to deployed code without manual handoffs
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation at every phase with clear acceptance criteria
- **Transparency**: Full visibility into agent decisions and reasoning
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can participate and review at any stage

#### For Individual Developers
- **Guided Process**: Step-by-step guidance through complex development tasks
- **Context Preservation**: No loss of information between sessions or tools
- **Learning Opportunity**: Understand best practices through agent demonstrations
- **Efficiency**: Focus on high-level decisions while agents handle implementation details

#### For Project Managers
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into project status and milestones
- **Risk Management**: Early identification of potential issues and dependencies
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient allocation of human and AI resources
- **Documentation**: Automatic generation of comprehensive project documentation

### Core Workflow Experience

#### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning
1. **User initiates project** with high-level description
2. **Analyst Agent** conducts stakeholder interviews and market research
3. **PM Agent** creates comprehensive PRD with clear requirements
4. **User reviews and approves** the requirements document

#### Phase 2: Architecture and Design
1. **Architect Agent** analyzes requirements and proposes system design
2. **User provides context** on technical constraints and preferences
3. **Architect creates** detailed architecture document and API specifications
4. **User validates** the technical approach and design decisions

#### Phase 3: Development Execution
1. **Scrum Master Agent** breaks down work into manageable stories
2. **Developer Agent** implements features with continuous feedback
3. **User reviews progress** and provides guidance as needed
4. **Agents collaborate** using A2A SDK for seamless handoffs

#### Phase 4: Quality and Deployment
1. **QA Agent** runs comprehensive tests and validation
2. **UX Expert Agent** ensures user experience quality
3. **Product Owner Agent** validates against original requirements
4. **User approves** final implementation for deployment

### Key Differentiators

#### 1. Context Persistence
- Rich context maintained across all phases and agents
- Symbolic mechanisms for abstract reasoning and memory
- Cognitive tools for complex problem-solving

#### 2. Agent Collaboration
- Standardized A2A SDK communication
- Real-time streaming updates and notifications
- Artifact exchange between specialized agents

#### 3. User Control
- Interactive decision points throughout the process
- Ability to override agent decisions when needed
- Full audit trail of all decisions and changes

#### 4. Quality Assurance
- Built-in validation at every phase
- Automated testing and compliance checking
- Continuous feedback loops for improvement
